## 📜 Info

As the original converter hasnt been updated in a long time, and has been archived, i have taken it upon myself to fix some bugs and maybe add .fnfc support

This is a song converter for [cabalex's Scratch FNF clone](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/519325355/).

The converter converts song JSON files made in the [Friday Night Funkin'](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin) or [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine) song editor

And as cabalex has stated, this really is Coded with [pretty bad] HTML and JS.

## 📃 To-do

- ~~Fix psych charts~~
  - Was caused by the removal of the initial song object
- Add fnfc Support

- Maybe more soon if someone makes a suggestion
